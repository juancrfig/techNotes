It's the practice of using [[Mathematics|mathematics]] and [[Science|scientific]] principles to design and build solutions to problems within the constraints of the real world. When designing and building the solution, engineers use a ***systematic*** approach and a ***methodical*** execution, respectively. Furthermore, engineers are mindful about the solution's ***[[Systems Development Life-cycle|life-cycle]]***, making sure that they are not only solving a problem for today, but making it easy to maintain and escalate in the long run.
