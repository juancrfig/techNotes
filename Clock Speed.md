[[Computer|Computers]] have an internal clock that puts all the components in synchrony. Each *tick* of this clock is known as a **clock cycle**, and it represents the smallest amount of time in which a *computer is able to execute a task*. 

*Clock speed* measures how many *ticks* a [[CPU]] can execute per second. 

*1 GHz* means *one billion of ticks per second*
