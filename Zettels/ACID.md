It's the design philosophy used for building **[[CAP Theorem|CP]]** [[Distributed System|distributed systems]].

- **Atomicity:** A *transaction* either occurs or not
- **Consistency:** A *transaction* never leaves the [[database]] in an invalid state
- **Isolation:** *Transactions* don't interfere with each other
- **Durability:** Completed *transactions* survive system crashes
