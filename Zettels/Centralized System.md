***

It's a type of [[system]] that is so ***tightly-coupled*** that one single failure in one of its ***nodes*** leads to a general collapse, this is known as a ***single point of failure***. 
The state of cohesion is so high, that these *systems* can be viewed as a single ***node*** that controls everything, leading to one of its strengths: ***single point of control***.
