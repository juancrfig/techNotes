[[Computer|Computers]] excel at comparing numbers, but when trying to compare [[Meaning|meaning]], they fall flat.
For *computers*, the word "Puppy" is as different from the word "Dog" as it's from the word "Sun".

*Word embedding* is a process that maps [[Token|tokens]] to **high-dimensional** [[Vector|vectors]]. 
Initially, these values are random numbers, but as the pre-training process occurs, these values start to converge in a way that *tokens* with similar *meaning* end up with similar *vector* representations.
