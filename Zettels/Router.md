It's a device that acts as the common point where different [[Network|networks]], usually located next to each other, send [[Information|data]], in form of [[Packet|packets]], to another *network*. 
*Routers* handle this *data* so its correctly sent to the target *network* by using [[IP address|IP addresses]] and a **routing table**. Furthermore, *routers* also play a key role on preventing neighbor *networks* accessing to each other.
