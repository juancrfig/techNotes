It takes the best of both [[Declarative Programming|declarative]] and [[Imperative Programming|imperative]] programming paradigms. ***OOP*** treats sections of the code as **entities**, simulating real-world objects. 

An *entity* can have:
- **Methods** 
- **Attributes** 

When defining these, an **imperative** approach is used. However, doing that allows to manipulate these entities with a high degree of abstraction, and thus, using them in a **declarative** way.

Some languages suited for *OOP*: [[Java]], [[C#]], [[Ruby]], [[Python]].
