***

It's a type of [[data structure]] in which each *item* stores also the *address* of the next *item* in the list, this is known as **sequential access**.

- **Reading:** **`O(n)`** 
- **Insertion:** **`O(1)`** 
- **Deletion:** **`O(1)`** 

Insertions and deletions are *constant time* only if you can instantly access the element to be deleted.
