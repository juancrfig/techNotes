Its core philosophy is to not alter directly state, but rather using ***pure*** [[Function|functions]] to receive a copy of a certain value and then return it.
Thus, it's all about ***immutability***.

*Pure functions* follow two unbreakable rules:
- **Its output depend only on its inputs**
- **It has no side effects**

*Functional programming* offers massive advantages with regard to ***predictability***, ***testability***, and ***safe-concurrent behavior***.
