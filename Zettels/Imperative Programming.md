- It explicitly specifies the **sequence of steps** a program must follow, and the details about **how**.
- It **changes the program's state** by modifying its variables directly.

This paradigm is actually a *spectrum*, almost all *programming languages* ***abstract*** logic from lower-level ones, so it's not like a language is either imperative or not, but how much it's. 
The closest *programming language* to the *imperative* edge is [[Assembly]].
