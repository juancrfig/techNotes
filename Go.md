It's a ***statically typed*** and [[compilation|compiled]] [[programming language]]. 
Each programs includes a small amount of extra code called the [[Go Runtime]].

## Data Types

**Signed Integers**
- `int8 int16 int32 int64` 
**Unsigned Integers**
- `uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64`
**Signed Decimals**
- `float32 float64`
The number at the end represents *bits*. `int` and `uint` refer to their respective 32 or 64-bit sizes, depending on the user's environment.

# Dictionary

- **Package:** A directory containing source files, allows organization, encapsulation and code reusability. 
- **Module:** The highest-level container of source  code. It's defined by the presence of the file `go.mod` at the directory's root.

## Random Facts

- *`const` variables must be known at compile time*.
- The data type `rune` is an alias for `int32`. An *32-bits* number is big enough to represent any *Unicode* symbol.
