It's a piece of *software* that, given a *text input*, it predicts what [[Token|word]] comes next.

***
###### A probabilistic model
When deciding what's the next word, it assigns a *probability* to words in a pre-selected set, and chooses the word  based on that. Here, configurations like ***temperature*** may alter the prediction. 
The lower the *temperature* the most consistent and *deterministic* the model will be, while the higher it's, the more randomness will be allowed in the answer.

*LLMs* have a limit of *tokens* they can process, this is called the ***context window***.
